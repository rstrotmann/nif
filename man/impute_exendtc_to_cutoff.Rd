\description{
In some instances, particularly when analyzing non-cleaned SDTM data from
ongoing clinical studies with multiple-dose administrations, the last
administration epoch in EX may have an empty EXENDTC field. Often, the
underlying reason is that the respective subjects are still on treatment.
This function replaces the missing EXENDTC with the global data cut-off
date, \code{cut_off_date}.
