Minimal imputation rule set
}
\details{
This imputation rule set includes the following minimal imputation steps:
\subsection{Treatment administrations:}{
\itemize{
\item Expand administration episodes from the EX domain between EXSTDTC and
EXENDTC.
\item Administrations inherit the administration time from EXSTDTC or EXENDTC.
\item The administration time is carried forward for
subsequent administration events until the next imputed time.
}
}
}
\section{Creating custom imputation rules}{

You can create your own imputation rule set by providing a named list
with any combination of the four function slots: \code{admin_pre_expansion},
\code{admin_post_expansion}, \code{obs_raw}, and \code{obs_final}. Each function
receives specific arguments depending on its slot.
