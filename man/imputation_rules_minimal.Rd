\description{
Minimal imputation rule set
}
\details{
This imputation rule set includes the following minimal imputation steps:
\subsection{Treatment administrations:}{
\itemize{
\item Filter administrations to the cut-off date.
\item Impute missing EXENDTC values in the last administration episode to the
cut-off date.
\item Impute missing (non-last) EXENDTC values to the day before the start of the
subsequent administration episode.
\item Remove records where EXENDTC is before EXSTDTC.
\item Expand administration episodes from the EX domain between EXSTDTC and
EXENDTC.
\item Administrations inherit the administration time from EXSTDTC or EXENDTC.
\item After the above imputations, the administration time is carried forward for
subsequent administration events until the next imputed time.
}
}
}
\section{Creating custom imputation rules}{

You can create your own imputation rule set by providing a named list
with any combination of the four function slots: \code{admin_pre_expansion},
\code{admin_post_expansion}, \code{obs_raw}, and \code{obs_final}. Each function
receives specific arguments depending on its slot.
