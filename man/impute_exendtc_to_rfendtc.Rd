\description{
In EX for multiple-dose studies, the EXENDTC field for the very last
administration epoch may be missing. This is occasionally found when SDTM
data are generated before full cleaning of the clinical data, e.g., in the
case of interim analyses of clinical study data. In some of these cases, the
DM domain is however already completed with the RFENDTC field. This is the
reference end date-time field that specifies the date-time of the last
treatment administration. This function completes EXENDTC for the very last
administration time based on the RFENDTC, if provided in DM.
