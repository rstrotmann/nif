\description{
Add rows to a \link{nif} object that represent drug administration events
(EVID of 1) This is usually the first step in the stepwise creation of NIF
data tables.
}
\details{
Drug administration data is taken from the EX domain of the source
\link{sdtm} object. The \code{extrt} argument specifies the drug name as
represented in EX. By default, this will also be the value of the 'ANALYTE'
column for the respective rows in the resulting \link{nif} object.
Alternatively, a custom \code{analyte} name can be explicitly provided, e.g., to
match with the 'ANALYTE' name of the corresponding pharmacokinetic
observations.

For administrations, a model compartment of 1 is selected by default and will
be the corresponding value of the 'CMT' column. A different compartment can
be explicitly specified by the \code{cmt} argument.
