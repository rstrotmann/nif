Alternative imputation rule set
}
\details{
This imputation rule set includes the following imputation steps:
\subsection{Treatment administrations:}{
\itemize{
\item Filter administrations to the cut-off date.
\item Impute missing EXENDTC values in the last administration episode to the
cut-off date.
\item Impute missing (non-last) EXENDTC values to the day before the start of the
subsequent administration episode.
\item Remove records where EXENDTC is before EXSTDTC.
\item Expand administration episodes from the EX domain between EXSTDTC and
EXENDTC.
\item For each administration event, take the administration time from
PCRFTDTC of the PC domain if there are related pharmacokinetic observations.
The name of the PK analyte (PCTESTCD) that corresponds with the administered
treatment (EXTRT) must be specified by the 'pctestcd' to
add_administration().
\item For administration events that have associated PK observations but PCRFTDTC
is not defined, back-calculate the administration time, if possible, from
the PK observations based on their nominal time (PCTPT).
\item Unless imputed by the above rules, administrations inherit the
administration time from EXSTDTC or EXENDTC.
\item After the above imputations, the administration time is carried forward for
subsequent administration events until the next imputed time.
}
}

\subsection{Observations}{
\itemize{
\item For all predose observations, TAFD is set to zero.
}
}
}
\section{Creating custom imputation rules}{

You can create your own imputation rule set by providing a named list
with any combination of the four function slots: \code{admin_pre_expansion},
\code{admin_post_expansion}, \code{obs_raw}, and \code{obs_final}. Each function
receives specific arguments depending on its slot.
