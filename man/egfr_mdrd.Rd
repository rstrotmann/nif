\title{Glomerular filtration rate estimation from serum creatinine (MDRD)}
\usage{
egfr_mdrd(crea, age, sex, race = "", weight = NA, molar = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{crea}{Serum creatinine in mg/dl.}

\item{age}{Age in years.}

\item{sex}{Sex encoded as number (female is 1) or character (female is "F").}

\item{race}{Race as per CDISC nomenclature. Black race is identified as the
occurrence of 'black' in the value.}

\item{weight}{Body weight. Not used in this formula but included for
compatibility.}

\item{molar}{Switch to select whether the creatinine value is in mg/dl
(default) or umol/l units.}
}
\value{
Estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73 m^2.
